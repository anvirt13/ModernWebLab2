User Project

This program allows you to read, create and delete users in the database system. The program initially starts with 3 users ; Anvir, Krystal, Nicole. 

As the program runs, one user is deleted and another one is created. By the end of the program, there are 3 users with the ID 1, 3, and 4.  Therefore, user 2 is deleted. 

file.txt and fileTwo.txt use node.fs to read and write in a text file.

fileOperations.js is updated to create an http server. 

App.js is a Restful API that has 3 students with their IDs and name stored inside. 

The updated Restful API displays multiple student with their grades with the use of a button.

    - If the user clicks "Show Students", it displays the students in order from their ID, with student number 1 at the top, and student number 7. 

    - If the user clicks "Show by Grade", it displays the students in order of their grade, with the student with the highest grade being displayed at the top, and the student with the lowest grade on the bottom.


With the new updates from Mini Project 3, the app.js file now has async/await implemented to it for a better code strucutre. There are also event loops and more advanced error handling.
