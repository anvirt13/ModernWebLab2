Student Data Project

Features: 
- This program allows you to read and log students and their grades in the database system.

- Users are allowed to sort students by either their first name in alphabetical order, or sort students by their grades from highest (A) to lowest (F).

- The CRUD portion of the app allows you to choose an existing .txt file from your computer and edit it/view it's contents. It also allows you to create a brand new app that you can name and once created, it shows the files in the "All Files" section where you can edit & delete them. 

Code Structure:
- App.js: The main React component for student data management.
- CrudApp.js: A React component for text file CRUD operations.
- fileOperations.js: The Express.js server for serving API endpoints and handling text file operations.
